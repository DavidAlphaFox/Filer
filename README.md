# Filer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/probonopd/filer.svg?branch=fork)](https://travis-ci.com/probonopd/filer)

A file manager that can also render the desktop. Intended to become a key component of https://github.com/probonopd/hello one day.

This is a fork of an earlier version of https://github.com/lxde/filer-qt, a Qt port of the LXDE file manager Filer.
